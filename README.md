## Hello, I am Teej!

I am <del>project manager</del>, web developer & programmer. I make rich web applications, usually with **ReactJS** and **Ruby on Rails**. I've recently been working with database-driven **NodeJS** web applications with **ExpressJS** and more recently _KoaJS_.

### Background...

**Backend Development** — I have been developing web applications since 2003. I started as a PHP developer working with _CodeIgniter_ and _CakePHP_. I have been using Ruby and along with the **Ruby on Rails** framework for the past 9 years. I have used it for all sorts of projects; full CMS websites, database-driven web applications and REST-driven frontend applications.

**Frontend Development** — Developing with **Javascript** has been been very exciting in the past 5 years. **ReactJS** has been my tool of choice when it comes to frontend development.

### Want to Learn...

I have always been fascinated by other programming languages. I have a few languages on my radar, namely Elixir and Go. I haven't had the opportunity to professionally work with them but I am keeping my keyboard and fingers warm for a chance to get at them.
