# Hello, I am Teej!

**Backend Development** — I have been developing web applications since 2003. I started as a PHP developer working with _CodeIgniter_ and _CakePHP_. I have been using Ruby and along with the **Ruby on Rails** framework for the past 9 years. I have used it for all sorts of projects; full CMS websites, database-driven web applications and REST-driven frontend applications.

**Frontend Development** — Developing with **Javascript** has been been very exciting in the past 5 years. **ReactJS** has been my tool of choice when it comes to frontend development.
