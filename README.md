## Hello, I am Teej! 💻 ☕

I am <del>project manager</del>, web developer & programmer. I make rich web applications, usually with **NodeJS** **React** and **Ruby on Rails**. Alongside Ruby and Rails and NodeJS development, I've recently been working with database-driven Shopify applications.

### Background...

**Backend Development** — I have developed web applications since 2003. I began as a PHP developer with CodeIgniter and CakePHP and have used Ruby on Rails for the past 13 years, continuing to contribute to Rails projects alongside newer work. I have built full CMS sites, database-driven web applications, and RESTful backends for front-end apps. Over the past four years I have focused heavily on Node.js, developing multiple large-scale applications used by thousands of users worldwide. 🥰.

**Frontend Development** — Developing with **Javascript** has been been very exciting in the past 5 years. **React** has been my tool of choice when it comes to frontend development.
